# Fuel Injector logic
- The fuel injector should be triggered for every third rotation of the camshaft.
- After a certain time interval (time for fuel to fill the engine) the fuel injector is made low and the spark plug is triggered for the engine combusition.
- This process happens in a loop to produce work from combusition in automobiles.
